//version

express current version ->  4.18.3

1st part (4) ->   Major / Breaking update. In existing code the first digit should not be updated otherwise it can break the existing application. 
if you are writing the new code from scratch you can use the updated. For eg in version 4 app.get works in version 5. they might change it to app.GET 

2nd part (18)   ->    Recommended Bug Fix (eg adding some new feature)

3rd part (3)  ->  minor fixes (optional)    that is express.js will have done some minor changes like  eg- changing some spellimg mistakes

V.IMP

^ (compatibality version ) symbol means whenever you do npm update express it will install all recommended and minor fixes automatically
last two digits can be changed
Eg - 4.18.3 can be updated to 4.18.4 or 4.19.0 but it cannot be updated to 15.18.0
because the major change it will not update that you have to do manually by uninstalling the current one and installing the latest.

~ (Approximately equivalent to version) symbol means whenever you do npm update express it will install only minor fixes automatically
only the last digit can be changed
